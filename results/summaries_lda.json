It's not one table, it's a bunch of tables jammed together and it's really huge and the entire cast is sitting around it, plus everyone that works in scenic and music and everyone's in that room and all the writers and that's where everything's decided- and I I remember over the years things just destroying killing at that table and then getting nothing at dress because it really worked when you heard it, but something about getting it on its feet and putting it up all the magic went away. It is good and I'm I'm trying to be better at like not qualifying things that should be positive and like, but here's the astris yeah, here's why it's not positive yeah well, but that's natural, that's a defensive mechanism that you've developed over millions of years of evolution. You know with three wings and takes off and then the the groom goes I'll, get you in pantomime and gets into a stop with camel they go up in the air and chase each other and then like the bride transfers over to the other plane and then lands with her hero and you're, like you, just did a sketch, where the chances of all of you dying was about eighty five percent, and you know we would have been impressed that the story like I know I know it wasn't the writing- that anybody came for. When you go back to Carlinville and you go to the general store and everyone's sitting around swapping stories, they must say like: What's that Conan O'Brien, like don't the people, do ask about you a lot yeah yeah and what kind of stuff do you say that you're really funny?", "99-invisible_matters-of-time": "You know three thousand miles away in the West like how how little consideration that it took to consider what their days might look like and how little consideration they had for the sun like it is telling to me that there's a denial of reality that goes along with this denial of human rights. So the railroad used the train network to keep track of time yeah it's sort of this weird Meta phenomenon, and so you have these dedicated timekeepers, who would arrive in a given town and then they'd hop off the train and they go show their watch to the stationmaster, because the local railroad operators need to know the precise time in London and then those same watch wearing travelers would hop onto another train to a different city and so on and so forth, and they go about basically updating clocks all across the country one station at a time that is wild. It was just seen as the modern forward thinking thing to do, and she says one fun example in her own research, where she could kind of see this plane out is actually the Jack The ripper case going through all those police reports was extraordinary because there they are at the end of the nineteenth century, saying at nine and sixteen and I'm thinking nine and sixteen that's ridiculously accurate. They speak weaker and our Muslim and they're very different, culturally from the Han majority which make up about ninety two percent of the country and for decades the Chinese government has worried about separatism in the region and it's led to pretty severe state sponsored suppression of Wer Life and to an ongoing genocide. So from about the six, you start to see little businesses setting up with people who have got some sort of timepiece, giving time information to other people, and so this is when the knock wrapper business is really in its heyday, where every urban working class neighborhood had its own knocker upper and that person would invest in a good, accurate time piece, almost like someone invested in a taxicab, medallion and then embark on this career and hope to pay that time, piece off and eventually start turning a profit and was it considered a good career? Exactly and Germany were the first country to realize, like hey one great way to save energy, is to do this daylight saving thing that Britain has been considering for all these years, so Germany brings it in and then immediately Britain becomes really jealous within a month after having rejected it for seven or eight years within a month that the germ is putting it in the British put it, and eventually the countries put in on both sides of the war and that's how we got daylight saving is because of World War, one that's amazing, and also keeping up with the Joneses during World War, one which is an amazing part of that story. If willet had lived one more year, he would have seen his idea implemented, because in one thousand nine hundred sixteen World War, one was in full swing and across all of the countries fighting in the war, there was an energy crisis because a lot of coalbinders had joined the military, so they wanted to save energy because there wasn't enough coal miners to actually provide the energy that they needed to run the country.", "npr-politics_cutting-unemployment": "We are going to take a quick break and when we get back a bit more about unemployment benefits and what they meant for employment, this message comes from NPR, sponsor three M: who is committed to protecting healthcare workers globally, TM employee Chris knows that healthcare workers, like his daughter, may need to get up close to provide patient care.

We talk about our masters of scale, we go in depth on this and the master of the scale courses up what she Hain't had done was shift the focus of teach for India's summer teacher training program, putting less emphasis on what the new teachers would be teaching and put a little bit more time into how the results impressed everyone. We respond to people who come to us and say I really want to start teach for Nigeria or whatever it may be, and then we come behind that we never get out in front of them as they work to develop the plan to adapt these principles to their contexts. Wasn't an education major, but the desperate state of the country school systems had been all over the news I became obsessed with that idea like it was my answer to what to do, and it was my thesis topic which I also hadn't thought of Wendy might have written her thesis gotten in her grade and been done with it, but the more she researched the more the idea wouldn't let go which led to a classic entrepreneurship moment. This is the sort of pattern wendy saw em merge after tea FRALL's launch in two thousand and seven, and it's fast success was nothing but good news, except that the sheer speed of scale force Wendy to make a choice we launched to teach for all with seven network partners in year, one and thirteen in year, two and by year five, there were twenty five and teach for America doubled in that time, from something like four thousand teachers to eight thousand.", "my-first-million_the-secret-to-being-great": "The second thing: crazy, crazy, high energy, so super high energy, so the Napoleon he went to Egypt to go conquer something and on his way, he stopped in like some island, where you like reorganized the government in three weeks, and he and he changed their currency.

If the President Dallies, if he acts like he's more powerless than he is, then we could see a situation where entire statewide elections are stolen next year, and that, of course, is the same focus that we've been talking about all year of you know the White House changing what it calls for, but but really it's a conversation about a handful of democratic senators, changing their mind on a pretty big issue and they've, given no indication that they want to change their mind on the fillowbuster yeah.

I think there is certainly a great deal of frustration, a number of, and it really depends on who you ask, I think about a conversation I had with Cliff Albright, who is one of the CO founders of black voters matter, and he in that conversation just sounded so exasperated that he feels like he sees Democrats, prioritize votes on infrastructure on roads and bridges, and yet the fundamental right to vote of people in this country of black people to put a finer plane on it if people of color isn't treated with the same severity.", "a16z_developers-as-creatives": "That's why they are becoming so influential in adoption cycles and sales cycles, because a developer can for free, read the documentation, make an evaluation of what they think the product is and then for literally dollars, build the prototype and test those hypotheses and put it in front of customers and actually do a Beta, and that is a completely revolutionary way to de risk these projects and take them from a bunch of hypotheticals, with a lot of budget and energy put in into signing contracts with vendors and taking meetings to actually just getting hands on a keyboard building the thing and putting in front of customers that empowered developer really transforms the go to market for Abi Companies. Toilo is amazing, but once a company starts spending hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, you can't rely on a relationship with a developer to maintain that level of spend because now you've got so many more stakeholders inside of the company developers want to do great work, but when the CFO is saying hey how come we're spending this much on Toyo, I mean you know, that's someone else's job right, and so we now call the developer first approach where developers start the relationship. They call it an Amazon because, as the company is growing, there's a natural tendency for every company, as they get bigger, to slow down, to insert more bureaucracy, to create walls between customers to create politics, and things like that and what small teams do is they keep a small group of people who are very tight and focused on what my definition is?

Ninety seven to two thousand, a group started conducting imaging tests that were done to see if any of the village remained underground in the mid two thousand and again in two thousand and eleven digs were conducted and they found the foundation walls of one of the homes and some other items that helped tell the story that Seneca village was once a vibrant, integrated middle class community.

They set up cuts, stations and assembly stations, electricians came in to install ventilation, fans for all the Sawdust and about ten carpenters got to work and we started bringing drafts of plywood, which is fifty sheets at a time, and we had six drafts of plywood and two drafts of two by fours and they didn't give us an end or, but we were just told. Yes, we'd stack them about five or six high until we got palettes and then we placed ten on a pallet shrink, wrap them, and I would take a forklift and back them into the elevator that drive them out onto the street up the street through the schoolyard down the next street to the back of a tractor trailer and getting honked at for a forklift that goes too slow, so they're honking at you, while you were driving the coffins yes and in three weeks of doing it, one person neighborhood ever asked a question: What are those or what are you doing? That happened to today's show I'd like to attempt to do a kind of accounting not of how many people died or how many are unemployed, but a different kind of national accounting of all the smaller private moments that unfolded in people's jobs all across the country, Maine, Arizona, Michigan, New York City, specifically essential workers. There was the beginning in which childcare centers lost money, even as their work became labeled, essential and then there's this moment now, where what was already a chronic problem of teacher turnover has become so much worse because the industry can't compete places like Walmart Home Depot, Fedex grocery store chains like Kroger kept making money over the pandemic.

I brought my kids out and this is a couple of years ago and I think that I'm going to say they were probably at the time, Fourteen and twelve, and I bring them my daughter and my son and we walk through the door and immediately as you greeted us and you said Hi, you handed them like a Sepuku, so a sword that you would use to disembowel yourself in the Japanese ritual, my house, my rules, yeah, you handed them deadly blades and we have photos of them running around the house. Then I don't think I'd be open to it, but I could see myself like I'm I'm judging these, ladies who go into this guy's house and he's like I'm going to drug you and whatever, but I would have probably done that yeah and I think what would have happened is he would have tried to sew you to the other person, something you would have escaped run through the woods, but then come back the next day. We were just all having a chat and then somehow we got onto the topic of the movie human centipede and then we quickly stopped and said: Let's get this on the podcast, because if you're going to talk about the human centipede movie, make sure that it is recorded make sure it's recorded and distributed to the masses.", "my-first-million_how-to-build-a-community": "My daughter she's too, like she can't tell maybe like a four year old, can tell or something like that, but but the parents always have to sit there with it and so like there's tons of online forums where people like did you see that they tried to just switch blippy on us like that, like whatever so, basically I don't know if they can switch flow at this point, maybe they can maybe they can't like the old spice guy, the Dosek's guy these become like part of the actual like they become like non fungible parts of the of the AD. Your professional ads that look highly polished people just skip past the Polish stuff, because you're looking for entertainment, so you have to look like the type of entertainment that looks like that's native on the platform, so this has created a shortage of people who can create great onscript on brand selfe content, and so I know this for our brand, but many many brands everybody's trying to farm this out to either influencers or agencies.

Most people view it as like a just a band aid like a bridge until we get to full ai, but I think there's going to be big companies that just do human and loloop stuff and one of the human and the loop things that I think's going to happen is remote, operated heavy machinery on construction sites, because if you take the people away, you reduce a lot of the danger. I never knew and drove me around the parking lot, no problem parked the car and I got out- and I was like: Oh that's, cool, that's Uber, but the driver's not here the driver is a video game player somewhere else and and then that gets even better because, okay, that's that takes advantage of geography right. The salesman podcast helps B to be sales professionals, learn how to find new potential buyers and went business in a modern, effective and ethical way. Maybe even they have life, but so they had like a free float of a multi billion dollar float for multiple years, and then they gave back the money, but for the deal was so hard to get into that all these middlemen who had allocation, I think you had to buy twenty million dollar slots. No, what is it okay, so every year wealthx is at Waltex is a company that is a database company and what they do is they basically use publicly available records, so property records and and sometimes you can get people's tax returns and things like that, and they look for people who are Ultra High Networth Ultra high net worth is defined as thirty million dollars in assets and they create this massive database. Let's say I have, I think my token I have like fifty thousand dollars of my own token cool my current usage, a bit count, big clouds, pretty low, my my belief in like it becoming the next big thing is, you know it started off like a long shot and now it's a it's a longer shot. It's in we're all like rich cool young people live it costs about two thousand or three thousand dollars a joint depending on how old you are, and they have one hundred thousand members and they recently went public at a three billion dollar market cap and the reason why their business isn't great is they took on a lot of debt. There's also other stuff like, for example, I think that being able to access deals and deal flow is like pretty important to people, or at least a certain set of people who have more more sort of money than than good investments and good investment opportunities around them and in the last pieces. I believe there's eight hundred to seven hundred thousand people in the world that are considered ultra high networth and all they do is they comb through loads of different data, and then they have independent researchers who work their hardest to verify that this is true and the reason why I discovered this is for years.", "99-invisible_stuff-the-british-stole": "Yeah- and you know in the in the the next episode of the series, that is a very core problem, where basically, we've got two guys who basically come into possession of something that belongs to a ruler that no longer exists, and then the the government in Nigeria were like well, we can have a back if it's a gigantic political act, and we can, you know, put on a song and dance about it, but that's not what the the people that owned the objects currently wanted, and so there's a huge amount of challenge. In a matter of hours, the city was already decked out with tinsels and bubbles, and there were Puffa jacketed office workers, cramming themselves into ritzy department stores, and then there was me virtually alone in this cavernous museum hall, struggling to understand why no one was taking notice of the almost life size soldier with the dilated pupils of a Korea stoner lying supine as a wild orange tiger, plunged its banks deep into the side of his neck. You know indigenous Australians have been around for sixty thousand years of the oldest continuous culture on earth, but when I was when I was going up through through school, the way it works is that you get one page of their indigenous people in Australia, and then Captain Cook arrived and that's when history starts right and I think that's true of a lot of you know western Western histories and there's a sense now of we need to go back and reexamine the past, and certainly in academic and historical societies. She actually explored the idea of an alliance that would throw the British out of India, so they had French advisors and soldiers, even who came and drilled their own troops and taught them new tactics, and you know doubtless were conduits for certain kinds of technology and certain kinds of maneuvers, which meant that you know to the extent that there was a technological gap between Western and Indian forces at that time, which wasn't huge even to begin with, that gap was flattened and not just methods to wage war. The title is strident right, but also, once you get into the stories you realize, the stories are really complicated and there are- and I and I say to people you know when we're approaching them to be in the series we are open to having the conversation about it being contested, and we are open to you saying no, it was not stolen, it was a gift or whatever you want to say what it really comes down to for me is it's about nuance right, so you have to be able to be honest with the audience and go well.", "masters-of-scale_make-it-epic": "That's three o'clock is the guy from myspace and they were all in a room trying to figure out how to get in front of the eyes and the ears of people, if sitting in on its manager's meetings, taught will how the business works sitting in on those meetings with Jimmy showed him something else. It was in meetings with Jimmy himself or will learned how it was done, Jimmy loved having different disciplines in the room so say, for example, it was one pm I had a meeting with Jimmy Classic Jimmy Ivy is that your one pm would start at two but you'll be sitting in the room with a meeting that lingered and here's the guy from activision. You want to build the tallest skyscraper you can you want to be the frank geary of your kidergarten as an industrious little builder, you realize that a super tall tower starts with a solid foundation, but there's a limit to how stable that tower can be, because it's still made of blocks that can slide apart a strong grease, a careless door, slam that towers coming down now swap those wooden blocks. Jimmy's first big hit as a producer, was a collaboration between Bruce Springsteen and Patty Smith and he built his career on unexpected pairings working with artists from you to and Tom Petty to fifty cent eminem and Dr Dre Jimmy told me something one day that sticks with me he's like well you're the kind of person. While I was writing a new album right when me and Mark Bennio relationship began Mark Bennioff is the Co. CEO of sales force will had partnered with them thro their new APP called chatter, and he saw an opportunity- and I said, hey mark- why don't you do a super bowl ad? Pow I'd be rocking them beats, will even wore them while being interviewed, Live on CNN in two thousand and eight he was on screen next to the legendary poet Maya Angelou, talking about Barack Obama's presidential campaign, Sporting, a pair of beats headphones with their signature, lower case b casually around his neck, and now we've almost come full circle back to will. One mom may love the fact that you talked to them at about their child and you are really involved and engaged in another mom like I just wanted to be in and out, and she talked team mates we're back one more time with the zawae Bryant Cofounder of night light pediatrics she's been telling us how our clinics innovated through crisis and actually grew their practice, but it's one thing to get new patients and another thing to keep them.", "radiolab_dinopocalypse-redux": "You go you're going back in time about ten thousand years and when you go all the way down all the way back to sixty six point nine million years, you will find this one little skinny strip of rock okay, that's a good one that this one skinny gray line this this gray crappy, oh, that this know in a very real way that line that you're, seeing that represents the day the asteroid hit the day, just above that line, that's a little bit after the day, just below that line was a little bit before today the line is called the Katie boundary and what's cool is you can actually touch it? We were so lucky to share the stage with those guys, along with video, maestro key scratch who was doing the live, video of our brilliant puppet here, Myron Goso, Oh, my God that guy's so good check out all of them at Radio Lab dot, Org lab you could see them doing what they do visually. If this is the line right here, this little strip here, Robert Traces, a picture of the Katie boundary with his finger, and then you dig just below the line you were going to find over and over again dinosaurs everywhere I mean they're not going to be a lot of course, he's just putting some toy dinosaurs under the line and making them move by giving them a certain amount of energy which I shouldn't but they're fossils, and you will find dinosaur fossils from Europe and Idaho and Montana. Well, I went home and I hooked up a current meter and tried to measure the amount of heat produced in my oven for different amounts of power, and I could get about seven kil watts per square meter in my oven on Broil and like five hundred degrees broil you, but that wasn't quite enough not nearly so j started measuring other kinds of ovens and I finally found out that the heat would be in fact like being in a pizza, oven. Twenty thousand miles an hour very fast twenty times faster than a very fast rifle bowler and scientists couldn't be sure what would happen mathematically I mean when an a mount ever in size, bullet traveling at twenty thousand miles an hour hits our atmosphere. Hmm, it claims to tell the story of the first fifteen minutes to three hours after the asteroid hit down in Mexico and basically, what it is is geologic formation that is kind of like that line that we saw Colorado but like that line on steroids and it's in the southwest corner of North Dakota, not close to so was not close to it's not close to the Gulf of Mexico at all.", "a16z_malaria-vaccine": "That's accelerated in the last year for sure I've seen it a whole new scale that I've never seen it before yeah, and you know some would say that, given that we were living in covid times were literally everyday matters in science that we have to accept science break press release, hopefully followed very quickly by peer reviewed publications, but the Pe Review and publishing process just takes too long frankly for Covid, and so we often end up having to rely on press releases and preprints. The way it's being approached from a vaccine standpoint is to prevent a mosquito from picking up malaria from a person that has it and the way you do, that is by designing a vaccine that will generate antibodies that are taken up by the mosquito, along with the parasites and preventing the parasite from reproducing inside the Mosquitos you're, giving a person a vaccine, that's not going to prevent their illness, it's going to prevent the parasite from reproducing in the mosquito, so you're actually indirectly vaccinating the mosquito and not the person, because that person could still get malaria illness. So you might have high medium and low doses of the vaccine to give you a sense as to what the right dose is to take it to further clinical development in phase to development you're, often going into a larger number of individuals and confirming that you are at the right dose, you might even still have different dose levels in your face to in a standard phase, two tried for infectious diseases you're not actually looking to see whether you're preventing infection, because there's a relatively small number of people in phase two trials and that wouldn't be enough to actually be able to statistically measure a difference in the vaccine group versus the Control Group. Basically, what both of these vaccines are doing are targeting the parasite in that speroite phase of the life cycle, which is when it enters the human body from the mosquito and the vaccines you're saying the main difference between the two vaccines, The r twenty one includes a higher concentration than the GSK, but that's the primary difference other than that, their relatively similar underlying mechanisms.", "a16z_crypto": "I think it's really helpful to look at recent history and, in particular, the sort of early days of platforms like twitter, facebook, spotify and others, each of which at one point had a very rich developer ecosystem built on top of their API, and that ecosystem was rich with third party applications that benefited users in the form of sort of more optionality, more ways to interact with these platforms and benefited developers, and that it was a way to you know, gain access to these surveys, gain distribution, and so it was a pretty exciting way to build a startup. So that's going back to the advent of computing, a World War II to them after that, mainframe to Min Computer to PCs, the Internet in the nine and then mobile phones in the two, thousands with each computing cycle, there's a new kind of computer invented and then that kicks off a wave of applications that are built on top and we end up with a virtuous fly wheel where the new applications help reinforce the new type of computer in the newspaper computer as it gets better, helps reinforce new kinds of applications, so so review, cryptoe or blockchains as a new type of computer, putting all those other primitives together kind of think of them as Lego bricks, you can make bigger lego bricks and one really exciting. What I mean is that, somewhere, along the way, you sign a terms of service that allows for the platform to monetize that piece of continent as they see fit, and maybe they give you a cut of the revenue, maybe not, but the platform gets to make that call, and they also get to make the call on how that content is consumed and there's not a whole lot of innovation going on there, because any developer, who plugs in to try to innovate, has been shut down in the past. Here's Alex Pruden, the traditional financial system is, you know, we trust banks and our banks, trust commercial banks and commercial banks, trust the Fed and it's kind of a hierarchy, and if, for whatever reason, that fraudulent transaction happens, there's like a legal mechanism by which those things can actually kind of be reversed and that doesn't exist in Crypto, necessarily because the whole point of it is to be decentralized and kind of prevent any one party from having that power, and so what ends up happening is a lot of people will trust third parties to custody.", "masters-of-scale_master-your-emotions": "Never ending challenges is tough, especially when the buck stops with you as the leader of your team, but it can be made far tougher if you are also struggling with stress, disappointment, embarrassment and self doubt, rather than trying to control what is by nature out of your control, you can look more closely at what you're doing with your own mind and cease to respond to sabotaging thoughts that hurt your ability to lead effectively and that impact valuable relationships with your team rather than trying to change the world in each moment. How I should be improving them, how I should be refining them, and most people can't make that case, and so my hope for the public intellectual evolution in society is that truth seeking becomes more of a aspirational and cultural norm which, obviously, today we are very far away from, and I think one heuristic there is to notice what your incentives are and to notice those times where what is true or acknowledging what is true or what you have every reason to believe is true, is going against the grain of those incentives and to just notice what you do at those moments. An alarm goes off in me and I want to I want to going to reset and it's not to say that I'm perfect at it, and it is true that I will occasionally have learned to pick my battles in the sense that you have to be aware that not every single fact that you could defend is worth defending at the first possible opportunity to defend it right, and so there's been some learning from me there, but I definitely err on the side of putting both feet in my mouth when it matters being honest about your endeavor is vital for you as a founder. How did you get into the public intellectual path, because part of the thing that I think is interesting, especially as we get to waking up and the APP is you start playing a scale public intellectual role, the intellectual honesty really has to be the ground truth of our conversation with one another, and so public intellectuals are the people who try to do that most deliberately and try to stand outside of any institutional pressure."}
